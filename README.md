# About
Glacier-Core is a plugin that extends a standard Spigot/Bukkit server by adding more functionality all-around. This plugin is similar to Essentials, but it has less unimportant features and more customization.


# Usage
Download the JAR file from the page on the Spigot/Bukkit website. Deploy it in your 'plugins' folder and run the server. As soon as the server is running, close it down and start configuring by going to the 'plugins/Glacier-Core' folder. After that you can run the server, which will be enhanced with Glacier-Core.
